# Web-Programming

1. HTML
    - Create a single HTML web page for a subject you like.
2. CSS simple
    - Write a web page which should contain in a table person images. The table should be formatted using a style sheet. When the mouse is over a person image a div containing information about that person should pop-up.

    - Write a web page which should contain a vertical menu. The menu should be displayed in the left side of the page and should contain at least 5 items (displayed vertically, one on top of each other) and each item should be expanded on the right side to a group of at least 5 commands.
  
4. CSS layouts 
    - Develop an html+css web document that looks like the following web page: https://www.python.org/. You should clone about one screen of this web page (not the whole web page) and your html document should look approximately 90% as the given web page. No interactivity should be added (e.g. javascript, :hover effects etc.).

5. JavaScript
    - Write a javascript which sorts in ascending order an array of numbers which are introduced by the user in a "textarea" or "input type=text" tag. The sorted array (which can have any length) will be displayed in a <table> with 5 columns and n/5 lines where n is the length of the array.
