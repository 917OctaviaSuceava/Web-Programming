# Web-Programming

1. HTML
    - Create a single HTML web page for a subject you like.
2. CSS simple
    - Write a web page which should contain in a table person images. The table should be formatted using a style sheet. When the mouse is over a person image a div containing information about that person should pop-up.

    - Write a web page which should contain a vertical menu. The menu should be displayed in the left side of the page and should contain at least 5 items (displayed vertically, one on top of each other) and each item should be expanded on the right side to a group of at least 5 commands.
  
4. CSS layouts 
    - Develop an html+css web document that looks like the following web page: https://www.python.org/. You should clone about one screen of this web page (not the whole web page) and your html document should look approximately 90% as the given web page. No interactivity should be added (e.g. javascript, :hover effects etc.).

5. JavaScript
    - Write a javascript which sorts in ascending order an array of numbers which are introduced by the user in a "textarea" or "input type=text" tag. The sorted array (which can have any length) will be displayed in a <table> with 5 columns and n/5 lines where n is the length of the array.
6. Jquery
    - Write a web page which displays in the middle of the browser window a horizontal slider containing a list of images. The slider should continuously slide from the left to the right side of the browser window. Each image that exits the browser window on the right side should enter the browser window on the left side. The sliding should be animated. If the user clicks on an image, the sliding is paused and a larger version of that window pops in the center of the browser window (just like images appear in the Lightbox javascript library). If the user clicks anywhere on this large image, the image dissapears and the sliding of the horizontal image bar is resumed.
