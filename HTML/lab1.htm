		<p>Led by singer, songwriter, and producer Dave Bayley, the group also features his childhood friends Joe Seaward, Ed Irwin-Singer and Drew MacFarlane. Bayley wrote and produced all three Glass Animals albums. The first, Zaba (2014), spawned the single "Gooey", which was eventually certified platinum in the United States. Their second full album, How to Be a Human Being, received generally positive reviews and won in two categories at the 2018 MPG Awards for UK Album of the Year and Self Producing Artist of the Year, as well as a spot on the Mercury Prize shortlist. The third, Dreamland, their first fully autobiographical album (Bayley had said he felt it was selfish to write about oneself), included the single "Tokyo Drifting" which peaked at number seven on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart.</p>

		<p>The band impressed with the video for their song <b>Agnes</b> from their second album. Bayley said "There is one song that stands apart from the rest. It is the most truthful, honest, and personal story I have ever written. And that song is ‘Agnes.’”. The music video features the singer in a human centrifuge.</p>
		<aside><b>Human centrifuges</b> are exceptionally large centrifuges that test the reactions and tolerance of pilots and astronauts to acceleration above those experienced in the Earth's gravity. The effects a human can feel while in a human centrifuge is loss of colour vision ("greyout"), followed by tunnel vision. It can lead to complete loss of vision and loss of conscience.</aside>
		<p>The singer described how he felt while filming the video for "Agnes", saying that he could feel his heart struggling to beat. He described this video-making experience as being the most intense he will ever have, but that it was "the only way that we could just about begin to simulate for a moment what happens within Agnes.".</p>
